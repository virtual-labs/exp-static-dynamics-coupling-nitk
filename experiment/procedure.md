Given data:
<br>
F<sub>0</sub> - Excitation Force (N) <br>
T<sub>0</sub> - Torque (Nm)<br>
&omega; - Angular velocity (rad/s) <br>
k<sub>f</sub> - Stiffness of front wheel suspension (N/m)<br>
k<sub>r</sub> - Stiffness of rear wheel suspension (N/m)<br>
m - mass of the automobile (kg) <br>
J - polar moment of inertia of cross section (kgm<sup>2</sup>) <br>
l<sub>1</sub> - length of front wheels from the center of gravity (m) <br>
l<sub>2</sub> - length of rear wheels from the center of gravity <br>

An automobile is visualised as a 2DOF system to visualise pith and bounce motions, the base excitation provided by the roads which trigger different modes, are observed by changing  T<sub>0</sub>, k<sub>f</sub>, and k<sub>r</sub>

1. Clicking on the simulation tab will open the simulator with default values

 2. Change the values of T<sub>0</sub>, k<sub>f</sub> and k<sub>r</sub> to observe the pitch and bounce of the model.
