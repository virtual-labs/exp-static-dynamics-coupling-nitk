An automobile carries passengers or goods from one place to another. Generally, it consists of a suspension, tire, and other electrical systems which assist in either the maintenance or efficient functioning of the vehicle. The automobile can be modeled as a two-degree-of-freedom lumped parametric system to study pitch and bounce motions, as shown in Figure 1.

As a two-degree of freedom system, x (bounce) and &theta; (pitch) are the independent parameters that will give the equations of motion.
