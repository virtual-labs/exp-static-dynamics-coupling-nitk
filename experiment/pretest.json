        "a": "The right answer is (c). In a two-degree-of-freedom system, the degrees of freedom refer to the number of independent motion modes. Specifically, it describes how many distinct ways the system can move or oscillate. These modes can include translational, rotational, or combined motions.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Steering mechanism",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (d). The steering mechanism primarily focuses on changing the direction of the vehicle by turning the front wheels. While crucial for vehicle control, it doesn’t inherently involve two independent coordinates like those seen in suspension systems.",
        "b": "The right answer is (d). While crucial for vehicle safety, the braking system doesn’t inherently involve two independent coordinates. It primarily focuses on slowing down or stopping the vehicle by applying friction to the wheels. The braking system’s behavior doesn’t fit the criteria of a two-degree-of-freedom system.",
        "c": "The right answer is (d). The engine’s cylinder arrangement determines factors like power output, efficiency, and smoothness of operation, but it doesn’t involve independent motion modes like those seen in suspension systems.",
        "d": "Correct, the right answer is (d). Suspension system is a example of 2DOF system in an automobile. It involves two independent coordinates (degrees of freedom) to describe the motion—typically vertical bounce (heave) and pitch (forward-backward motion)."
